# HackBU2018
These are the files that I created during the 2018 HackBU Hackathon

The file included is the final project that was subitted for judging. The files omitted from this file are files that I worked on during the hackathon. I attempted to take the inputted data and model it using Linear SVM modeling as opposed to the algorithm we created. Although I learned much more about machine learning during the course of the Hackathon, I was unable to properly label and normalize the data in time, thus leading to very poor output from the machine learning algorithm. 


I will most likely contiune this project on my own, and go more in depth into the machine learning section. I want to ultimately make this algorithm completely autonomous and give output upon request. I will devote this project to its own repository in the future.
